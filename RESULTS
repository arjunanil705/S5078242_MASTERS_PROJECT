 The Project has taken 3 Machine Learning algorithms to predict Systolic Blood Pressure from PPG derived features in the context of cuff-less estimation. To tackle some of the issues which could hinder the efficiency of Machine Learning algorithms, the Project took 3 Hyper-parameter tuning methods to analyse whether the Hyper-parameter tuning methods can have a positive impact on the prediction accuracy of the Machine Learning algorithms. The Project concludes with the following points:

• In total 30 features were taken for Machine Learning analysis which were a combination of PPG and Biometric features. The feature selection method showed that only 24 among the 30 were informative of the Systolic Blood Pressure with Age of the user being the most informative feature among the 30 while the Fundamental component magnitude of the PPG signal was found to be the most informative PPG feature.
•	Among the 3 Hyper-parameter tuning methods the Random Search tuning method improved the accuracy of all the 3 algorithms which were Support Vector Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and Neural Network in predicting the Systolic Blood Pressure while the Grid Search tuning method improved the accuracy of the Support Vector and Random Forest Regressors  and the Bayesian Search improved the accuracy of the Random Forests and Neural Network models.
•	The best Hyper-parameter tuned algorithm in terms of MAE was the Bayesian Search tuned Neural Network model which got down to 12.60 mmHg from 12.98 mmHg which was the MAE of the non-Hyper-parameter tuned Neural Network, with the improvement in accuracy being 3%.
•	The Random Search tuning method took the lowest time to find the optimum Hyper-parameters for all the algorithms by taking around 1.3 minutes in average while the Bayesian Search took 4 and Grid Search took 130 minutes on average respectively.
